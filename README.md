## Key Neovim Features

#### Init written in fennel and compiled to lua

#### Lua utils library

#### My own help file and tags generator

#### Snippets library

#### Cool Vimscript and Lua functions

#### Telescope and many other awesome plugins configured

#### IDE like experience + heaps of vim tricks

#### Now featuring a parser based treesitter for syntax highlighting and other goodies.

Demonstrated here with a minified CSS file. We can see easily the limits of regex based syntax. Treesitter has numerous other benefits too, such as speed.

# Plus tons of awesome shell scripts. Enhanced rm, cd and more. Git commands + FZF + Shell awesomeness = productivity level over 9000.

#### FZF Enhanced rm. Delete multiple files at once interactively!
